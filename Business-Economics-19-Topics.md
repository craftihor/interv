- DPDP Act (2023): Health data protection; phased implementation (2025-26)
- Telemedicine guidelines: NDHM standards for remote consultations
- Insurance regulations: IRDAI rules on digital insurance products
- Payment systems: RBI regulations on fintech payment platforms
- Cybersecurity: CERT-In requirements for health data handling

**Challenges:**
- Data privacy: Health data highly sensitive; breach penalties high
- Interoperability: NDHM standards not uniformly adopted
- Liability: Who's responsible if AI diagnosis erroneous?
- Consumer protection: Inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms
- Regulatory fragmentation: Different rules across insurance, healthcare, fintech

### Arguments FOR FinTech-Healthcare Integration

**Benefits:**
1. **Access**: Digital payments enabling rural, low-income populations
2. **Affordability**: Medical credit (BNPL) making care accessible
3. **Efficiency**: Automation reducing administrative costs 20-30%
4. **Quality**: AI diagnostics improving accuracy, consistency
5. **Innovation**: Data analytics enabling preventive care

**Evidence:**
- India's UPI adoption: 21.6B transactions/month (Dec 2025); healthcare integration rapid
- Telemedicine growth: 45% CAGR; usage spike post-pandemic persistent

2. **Algorithmic bias**: AI systems biased against minorities
3. **Equity**: Digital-first excludes illiterate, offline populations
4. **Debt risk**: Medical credit trapping poor in debt cycles
5. **Quality control**: Fintech companies prioritizing profit over care
6. **Monopoly risk**: Tech giants entering healthcare, consolidating power

**Real Challenges:**
- Data breaches: Healthcare increasingly targeted (high-value data)
- AI bias: Diagnostic systems showing racial bias (studies document)
- Debt trap: Medical loans enabling access but creating default risk
- Regulatory lag: Laws not keeping pace with tech evolution
