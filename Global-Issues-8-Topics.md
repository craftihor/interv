2. **Weak Accountability**: Institutions underfunded; enforcement weak
3. **Cultural Factors**: "Jugaad" mindset normalizing rule-bending
4. **Necessity**: Poor resorting to bribes for basic services (desperation)
5. **Prevalence**: Widespread nature making refusal difficult
6. **Survival**: Some officials relying on bribes for livelihood

**Reality:**
- 50-62% of Indians have paid bribes (normalized)

- Labor Share Declining: Worker wages falling as share of GDP

**Globalization & Outsourcing:**
- Manufacturing: Outsourced to low-wage countries
- Services: BPO reducing middle-skill job market
- Wage Arbitrage: Developed country wages under pressure
- Migration: High-skill migration concentrating in developed nations

### Verdict (2026 Assessment)

**Income Inequality is GROWING, UNSUSTAINABLE:**

**Realities:**
- Inequality widening in most countries
- Causes structural (automation, globalization, capital concentration)
- Consequences serious (growth slowdown, instability, health impacts)
- Solutions politically difficult (vested interests resisting)

**Policy Options:**
1. **Tax Reform**: Progressive taxation; capital gains taxation; wealth tax (track record mixed)
2. **Education**: Expand access (long-term, incremental)
3. **Labor Rights**: Union organizing; collective bargaining (declining globally)
4. **Safety Net**: Expand social security (fiscal constraints)
5. **Antitrust**: Break up monopolies (corporate lobbying resisting)
6. **UBI**: Universal Basic Income (pilot programs exploring; evidence mixed)

**Likely Outcomes (2030):**
- Inequality continuing to widen (structural causes accelerating)
- Protests increasing (social discontent rising)
- Policy changes incremental (vested interests blocking radical reform)
- Regional variation: Progressive countries addressing; conservative countries widening

**Key Challenge:** Balancing growth, incentives, fairness, sustainability while addressing automation, capital concentration, globalization impact.
