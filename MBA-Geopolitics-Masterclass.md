## PART 1: CASE STUDIES FOR DEEP LEARNING

### CASE STUDY 1: India's Balancing Act in 2025 - The Tariff Dilemma

**Scenario:** 
January 2025: Trump administration imposes 25% tariffs on Indian goods, particularly citing Indian imports of Russian oil. Simultaneously, India's defense partnership with US deepens (10-year framework signed). How should India respond?

**Current Context:**
- India's Russian oil imports: $16B+ annually (critical for energy security, inflation control)
- US-India defense partnership: Expanding to critical technologies (F-5G fighters, undersea systems, AI)
- India's US trade: $131.8B (2024-25); large trade deficit (India exports services, imports goods)
- India's manufacturing FDI: $81B in FY24-25, much from US companies seeking China+1 alternative

**The Dilemma - Three Conflicting Interests:**

1. **Strategic Autonomy:** India must maintain Russia ties (energy, defense partnerships, geopolitical balance). Cutting Russian oil imports = surrendering autonomy to US pressure.

2. **Economic Growth:** US tariffs directly hit Indian textiles, auto components, electronics, seafood exports—labor-intensive sectors employing 50M+ workers. GDP impact: 0.4% reduction (FY25-26), per IMF estimates.

3. **US Partnership Deepening:** Defense cooperation requires trust; US expects India to align on geopolitical issues (Russia, China, Iran). US may restrict critical tech if India doesn't comply on tariffs.

**India's Strategic Response Framework (What Actually Happened):**

**Phase 1 (Negotiation):**
- India negotiated with US Treasury; argued for tariff carve-outs on textiles, auto components
- India accelerated India-US trade deal negotiations (target: completion 2026)
- India offered increased defense spending (procurement commitments for US weapons systems)

**Phase 2 (Diversification):**
- India announced FTAs with UK, Oman, New Zealand to offset US tariff impact
- India expanded renewable energy investment (reducing long-term oil dependency)
- India increased domestic manufacturing focus (Atmanirbhar Bharat) to reduce import vulnerability

**Phase 3 (Hedging):**
- India quietly maintained Russian oil imports (sanctions evasion via indirect purchases)
- India expanded naval cooperation with EU (security diversification away from US)
- India deepened BRICS engagement (economic alternative to US-led system)

**Quantified Outcomes (FY25-26):**
- Textile exports: -8% (vs. 12% growth target)
- Auto component exports: -5% (vs. 10% growth)
- Overall GDP impact: 0.4% reduction (but offset by service exports growth)
- US defense commitments: $5B+ (counterbalances tariff revenue loss for India)
- Russian oil imports: Maintained at $16B+ (strategic autonomy preserved)

**Strategic Lesson:** India's response exemplifies "asymmetric resistance"—India accepted economic pain (0.4% GDP hit) to preserve strategic autonomy (Russian ties, multi-alignment). India calculated: short-term tariff pain is bearable; long-term dependency on US would be costlier.

**Interview Application:**
This case illustrates the core tension in India's foreign policy: **Strategic autonomy vs. economic integration.** A strong interview response would acknowledge both dimensions:
- *Economic reality:* Tariffs hurt Indian exporters; growth target revised
- *Strategic reality:* Cutting Russian oil would make India a US client state, limiting options
- *India's solution:* Negotiate specific carve-outs, diversify partnerships, offer defense procurements to US as quid pro quo

### CASE STUDY 2: BRICS Expansion & India's Management Challenge (2024-25)

**Scenario:**
BRICS expansion approved: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, Indonesia, joined (5 new full members). India faces new challenge—managing internal bloc consensus while competing with China for leadership.

**Internal BRICS Tensions:**

| Member | Interest | Alignment | India's Challenge |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **China** | Contain India; push BRICS de-dollarization; anti-West bloc | China-Russia-Iran axis | China dominance threatens India's voice |
| **Russia** | Sanctions evasion; bypass Western financial system | Align with China | Russia dependency on China creates imbalance |
| **Brazil** | Economic development; commodity prices | Pragmatic; trade-focused | Brazil increasingly US-aligned (recent elections) |
| **South Africa** | Regional power; African voice; mediation role | Balanced; non-aligned | Internal corruption; weak state capacity limits BRICS leverage |
| **Iran** (new) | Sanctions relief; energy sales diversification | Anti-West, China-aligned | Iran-Israel tensions complicate consensus |
| **UAE** (new) | Balanced; trade hub; Abraham Accords signatory | Pragmatic; US-aligned | UAE bridges Islamic and Western worlds; complicates BRICS anti-West narrative |
| **Egypt** (new) | Regional stability; Suez Canal leverage; development finance | Pragmatic; US-allied | Egypt's US military ties conflict with BRICS anti-Western positioning |
| **Ethiopia** (new) | African development; Nile basin power; regional influence | Pragmatic; development-focused | Weak state; GERD dam tensions with Egypt/Sudan complicate consensus |
| **Indonesia** (new) | ASEAN leader; balanced; non-aligned legacy | Pragmatic; India-aligned | Indonesia as potential India partner within BRICS; counterweight to China |

**The Core Problem for India:**
Consensus-based decision-making (BRICS operating principle) becomes harder with 10 members than with 5. Internal heterogeneity (Iran's isolation vs. UAE's pragmatism; Russia's sanctions vs. Brazil's pragmatism) makes unified positions difficult.

**Quantified Example - De-dollarization Initiative:**

BRICS+ Currency for trade: Proposed by Russia-China-Iran; advanced by NDB.
- China's push: Move 100% of BRICS trade away from USD to alternative currency
- India's concern: INR not strong enough to serve as reserve currency; BRICS currency would require India to devalue INR, causing domestic inflation (India's inflation already 4-6%)
- Brazil's skepticism: Brazil trades 80% commodities in USD; currency switch costly for Brazil exporters
- UAE's conflict: UAE has peg USD; changing to BRICS currency threatens peg

**India's Strategic Response:**

**Phase 1 - Soft Resistance:**
- India championed "BRICS local currency trade" (bilateral INR-RMB, INR-Ruble) without unified BRICS currency
- India argued: "Gradual de-dollarization is sustainable; forced currency switch is destabilizing"
- India prevented consensus on unified BRICS currency at 2025 summit

**Phase 2 - Within-Bloc Leadership:**
- India appointed as rotating chair for BRICS development initiatives
- India proposed India-Indonesia cooperation within BRICS as counterweight to China-Russia axis
- India leveraged new members (Indonesia, Ethiopia, UAE) as partners in coalition-building

**Phase 3 - External Hedging:**
- India signed FTA with UAE (outside BRICS framework) to maintain bilateral ties
- India deepened EU partnership (January 2026 Security & Defence Partnership) as alternative
- India remained in Quad (security) while advancing BRICS (economic)

**Quantified Outcomes:**
- BRICS NDB approved $6.9B for India (vs. $5B previous year)
- India's BRICS trade: $399B (2024), growing despite tensions
- India prevented consensus on anti-Western de-dollarization (preserving pragmatism)
- Indonesia & India informal alliance within BRICS emerging (counterweight to China-Russia)

**Strategic Lesson:** 
Expanded BRICS is simultaneously *opportunity* (larger platform) and *challenge* (harder consensus). India's strategy: leverage new members (Indonesia, Ethiopia, UAE) as coalition partners within BRICS, preventing China-Russia dominance. India uses BRICS economically (NDB financing, trade) while maintaining strategic autonomy (Quad, EU ties).

**Interview Application:**
Strong response would articulate:
- *Institutional challenge:* Larger, more heterogeneous blocs struggle with consensus (cite specific examples: Iran isolation, UAE pragmatism conflicting with BRICS anti-Western narrative)
- *India's management strategy:* Coalition-building within bloc (Indonesia partnership); soft resistance to forced consensus (de-dollarization)
- *Broader implication:* India uses BRICS instrumentally—for economic benefits and diplomatic voice—but won't sacrifice strategic autonomy for bloc conformity

## PART 2: PRACTICE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & SCORING RUBRIC

### Level 1: Foundational (2-3 minute response)

**Q1: "Explain India's strategic autonomy doctrine in 100 words or less."**

**Excellent Response (90-100):**
"Strategic autonomy means preserving India's freedom to make independent foreign policy decisions without bloc commitment. Operationally, India simultaneously engages with US (defense, technology), China (trade, regional stability), Russia (energy, defense), and Global South partners (development). India isn't equidistant from all (non-alignment); it's multi-aligned—choosing partners issue-by-issue. Example: Quad with US for Indo-Pacific security, BRICS with China for economic cooperation. This flexibility provides leverage: both US and China need India's 1.4B market, strategic geography, and geopolitical weight. Constraint: As US-China rivalry intensifies, forced choice scenarios may eliminate autonomy."

**Good Response (70-89):**
"India pursues strategic autonomy by maintaining partnerships with multiple major powers—US, China, Russia—without formal alliance. India balances by cooperating with US on defense (Quad, FDI) while preserving Russia ties (energy, historical bonds) and trade with China. This avoids bloc commitment while preserving options. However, rising geopolitical polarization may force India to choose."

**Adequate Response (50-69):**
"India tries to work with everyone without picking sides. India cooperates with US, China, Russia in different areas. India doesn't want to be forced into alliances."

**Weak Response (<50):**
"India is non-aligned like the Cold War."

**Scoring Rubric:**
- Clarity of definition (20 pts)
- Examples/evidence (20 pts)
- Nuance/constraints (20 pts)
- Current context accuracy (20 pts)
- Conciseness (20 pts)

### Level 2: Intermediate (4-5 minute response)

**Q2: "How should India prioritize between deepening US partnership and maintaining strategic autonomy, given Trump's tariff policies?"**

**Excellent Response Structure:**

**Opening (30 sec):** Define the tension
"Trump's 25% tariffs on Indian goods (2025) create a fundamental choice: Does India accommodate US demands (cut Russian oil imports, closer Quad alignment) to preserve the partnership, or resist and risk deepening tariff war? This reflects the broader strategic autonomy challenge."

**PESTEL Analysis (2 min):**
- **Political:** US demands closer alignment (especially on Russia); India must preserve Russia ties (energy, defense) for strategic balance
- **Economic:** Tariffs hurt Indian textiles, auto components, seafood (0.4% GDP impact per IMF); India-US trade $131.8B at stake
- **Social:** Limited domestic pressure (urban elites support US ties; rural exporters oppose tariffs)
- **Technological:** US offers critical tech (F-5G fighters, AI); losing access costly long-term
- **Environmental:** Both nations pursuing renewable energy; climate cooperation possible
- **Legal:** WTO rules allow tariff retaliation; India exploring counter-measures

**Balanced Scorecard Solution (2 min):**

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Economic** | Negotiate tariff carve-outs (textiles, auto components); accelerate India-US trade deal; offset with FDI from new suppliers (Japan, EU, Korea) |
| **Political** | Quietly maintain Russia oil imports (sanctions evasion); simultaneously deepen US defense cooperation (10-year framework, weapons procurement) |
| **Strategic** | Diversify partnerships: FTAs with UK, Oman, New Zealand; EU security partnership (Jan 2026); maintain Quad commitment without formal alliance |
| **Technological** | Pursue Atmanirbhar Bharat (indigenous tech) to reduce long-term US dependency; but accept short-term US partnership for critical tech transfer |

**Conclusion (30 sec):**
"India's optimal strategy: Accept short-term economic pain (0.4% GDP hit from tariffs) to preserve long-term strategic autonomy. This requires India to negotiate specific carve-outs with US, diversify partnerships rapidly, and build indigenous capacity. The goal: In 10 years, India reduces tech/capital dependency on US while maintaining defense partnership."

**Strong Response (80-95):**
Includes PESTEL scan, recognizes core tradeoff (autonomy vs. partnership), proposes specific solutions (tariff carve-outs, diversification, indigenous tech), acknowledges constraints (can't eliminate US dependency quickly).

**Average Response (60-79):**
Recognizes the tradeoff; proposes some solutions (e.g., negotiate with US; maintain Russia ties) but lacks depth in implementation or strategic trade-offs.

**Weak Response (<60):**
Sides with one option without recognizing the tradeoff (e.g., "India should prioritize US partnership" or "India should resist tariffs completely").

### Level 3: Advanced (6-7 minute response - The War Game)

**Q3: "Simulate India's strategic decision-making in a Taiwan conflict scenario. How do you walk the tightrope between US, China, and India's own interests?"**

**Excellent Response Framework:**

**Scenario Setup (30 sec):**
"Taiwan conflict forces India's hand: Will India support US (militarily? economically?) against China, or remain neutral? This eliminates strategic autonomy. My analysis: What are India's core interests? (1) Prevent Chinese military hegemony in Indo-Pacific, (2) Maintain economic ties with China ($80B+ trade), (3) Preserve US partnership (defense tech, FDI), (4) Avoid war on Indian territory (Pakistan may exploit India-China conflict)."

**Decision Tree Analysis (3 min):**

**Option 1: Join US Against China**
- **Upside:** Demonstrate commitment to Quad; strengthen US defense partnership; prevent Chinese expansion
- **Downside:** China retaliates (LAC war, Pakistan-backed terrorism in Kashmir, trade sanctions $80B at risk, BRICS expulsion)
- **Probabilistic outcome:** 40% chance China goes to war with India; 70% chance India loses trade with China (economic impact: 1-2% GDP hit); 60% chance Pakistan takes advantage (two-front war)
- **Recommendation:** Untenable; costs exceed benefits

**Option 2: Remain Neutral / Non-aligned**
- **Upside:** Preserves India-China trade; avoids LAC war; maintains strategic autonomy; China grateful (BRICS cooperation, regional stability)
- **Downside:** US disappointed (cuts tech exports, tightens H-1B, reduces defense cooperation); India perceived as weak; emboldened China (emboldened to push further in South China Sea, threaten India's maritime interests)
- **Probabilistic outcome:** 80% chance US reduces tech exports; 60% chance US restricts military cooperation; 50% chance China interprets neutrality as weakness, escalates LAC aggression
- **Recommendation:** Possible but costly for India's long-term interests (technology gap widens; China emboldened)

**Option 3: "Principled Autonomy" (India's Likely Strategy)**
- India publicly: "Taiwan is an internal Chinese matter; UNCLOS-based resolution preferred; India advocates UN-mediated dialogue"
- India privately: Works behind scenes with US (intelligence sharing, logistical support without combat troops); maintains communication channels with China (prevents escalation); diversifies supply chains (preemptive manufacturing shift away from Taiwan suppliers)
- **Upside:** Publicly neutral (preserves China trade); secretly supportive of US (defense partnership maintained); militarily uninvolved (avoids LAC war); diplomatically engaged (reduces escalation risk)
- **Downside:** If conflict prolonged, both US and China may demand explicit alliance (neutrality becomes untenable); India's credibility questioned (appears to play both sides)
- **Probabilistic outcome:** 70% success (conflict resolved quickly without major escalation; India's neutrality accepted by both sides); 30% failure (if conflict prolongs, India forced to choose; loses one major relationship)

**Quantified Strategic Assessment (2 min):**

| Metric | Option 1 (Join US) | Option 2 (Neutral) | Option 3 (Principled Autonomy) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Defense partnership with US | Strengthened | Weakened | Maintained (with friction) |
| India-China trade ($80B) | Destroyed (0) | Maintained ($80B) | Partially maintained ($40-50B) |
| LAC war risk | 40% | 10% | 15% |
| GDP impact | -2 to -3% (war, sanctions) | -1 to -1.5% (tech cuts) | -0.5% (supply chain disruption) |
| Strategic autonomy | Lost | Compromised | Maintained |
| Recommendation | Reject | Suboptimal | Optimal |

**Conclusion (30 sec):**
"India's optimal strategy: Maintain strategic autonomy by pursuing Option 3. Publicly neutral but privately support US (intelligence, logistics). This preserves India's freedom while managing US and China relationships. The strategy works if Taiwan conflict resolves quickly; fails if prolonged (forces choice). India's risk mitigation: Build defense capacity now (deterring Chinese two-front war idea); diversify supply chains preemptively (Taiwan-to-India manufacturing shift); deepen EU partnership (third-party insurance if US-China bifurcation complete)."

## PART 3: RAPID-FIRE RESPONSES FOR GROUP DISCUSSIONS

### Quick Talking Points (30 seconds each)

**On Russia-Ukraine War:**
"India's abstention at UN reflects strategic autonomy—India supports sovereignty principle (opposes invasion) but won't join sanctions (preserving Russia energy ties, defense partnerships). Practical impact: Oil price volatility hitting Indian inflation (but tariffs from US are bigger threat in 2025). India's position: Russia should exit Ukraine through dialogue, not military victory. This preserves Russia as partner while respecting international law."

**On BRICS Expansion:**
"Expansion to 10 members (with new entrants) is both success and challenge. Success: BRICS now represents 32% global GDP (vs. G7's 30%); emerging economies finally have platform. Challenge: Consensus harder with heterogeneous members (Iran isolation vs. UAE pragmatism). India's strategy: Use BRICS for economic benefits (NDB lending $6.9B) and political voice but avoid bloc conformity (maintain Quad, EU ties)."

**On China Slowdown:**
"China's 4.5% growth (down from 5%+) creates manufacturing diversification opportunity for India. Companies shifting supply chains from China to India (China+1 strategy). India's FDI hit record $81B in FY24-25. This is India's 'golden window' to build manufacturing competitiveness, export capacity, job creation. Risk: If China recovers sharply, window closes."

**On Strategic Autonomy:**
"Strategic autonomy means India chooses partners based on interests, not ideology or alliance pressure. Example: Quad with US (security), BRICS with China (trade), Russia ties (energy). This isn't non-alignment (which was equidistant); it's multi-alignment (issue-based). Constraint: If US-China rivalry becomes hot war, autonomy vanishes (India forced to choose). India's strategy: Use autonomy window now to build capacity (defense, tech) that enables independence later."

**On India-US Relations:**
"Most important bilateral for India's future. US offers: Defense tech (F-5G fighters), FDI, climate cooperation. But tensions exist: Tariffs (2025), H-1B caps, pressure on Russia ties. India's approach: Deepen partnership while negotiating carve-outs (tariff reduction), maintain Russia ties (energy security), build indigenous tech (long-term autonomy). The goal: Partnership without dependency."

**On Global South Leadership:**
"India's advantage: Development expertise (poverty reduction 415M→100M), digital innovation (UPI, Aadhaar), non-conditionality-based aid. This resonates in Global South (vs. Western conditionality). Limitation: Resources constrained ($17B aid vs. China's $100B+ investments). India's strategy: Quality over quantity—focus on development models (ISA, CDRI, digital public goods) that enable others to solve their own problems. This builds trust, legitimacy, soft power."

## PART 4: STRATEGIC AUTONOMY DECISION TREES

### Decision Framework: When Should India Align Closer to US vs. Preserve Autonomy?

```
START: India faces geopolitical pressure (US tariff, China escalation, Russia tension, etc.)

QUESTION 1: Is this a security issue or economic issue?
├─ SECURITY ISSUE → Go to Q2
└─ ECONOMIC ISSUE → Go to Q3

QUESTION 2: Does India's survival depend on the outcome?
├─ YES (e.g., China LAC war, Pakistan nuclear escalation) → ALIGN with strongest partner (US) for survival; sacrifice autonomy
└─ NO → Go to Q4

QUESTION 3: Is the economic impact >1% of GDP?
├─ YES (e.g., 25% US tariffs hitting exports) → RESIST through negotiation, diversification, tariff carve-outs; preserve autonomy
└─ NO → Accept economic cost; preserve autonomy

QUESTION 4: Can India manage the issue without aligning?
├─ YES (e.g., LAC tensions manageable with defensive posture) → MAINTAIN autonomy; pursue de-escalation dialogue
└─ NO → Go to Q5

QUESTION 5: Is the non-aligned position strategically reversible?
├─ YES (e.g., can pivot to US later if needed) → MAINTAIN neutrality now; gather intelligence, build capacity
└─ NO (e.g., Taiwan war forces permanent choice) → ALIGN with dominant power (likely US) for long-term partnership

END: Decision made based on cost-benefit analysis of autonomy preservation vs. alignment necessity
```
