### 5. **Electoral Bonds: Fair or Unfair?**

#### Scheme Details & History
- **Introduction (2017)**: Modi government introduced Electoral Bond Scheme via Money Bill (Finance Act 2017)
- **Sale Mechanism**: Issued by State Bank of India (SBI) in denominations of ₹1,000 to ₹1 crore
- **Anonymity**: Bonds issued without disclosure of donor; received by SBI, forwarded to party bank accounts
- **Removal (February 15, 2024)**: Supreme Court struck down scheme in unanimous 5-judge bench decision[410][413][416][419]

#### Supreme Court's Four Pillars of Unconstitutionality[410][413]

**1. Money Bill Misuse**
- Electoral Bonds treated as "Money Bill" to circumvent Rajya Sabha scrutiny
- Modi's BJP lacked Rajya Sabha majority; scheme avoided upper house voting
- Clear violation of Article 110; blatant fraud on parliament

**2. Fiscal Transparency Risk**
- Increased risk of cross-border counterfeiting
- Unchecked foreign funding possible; RBI and ECI cautioned
- Internal institutional processes circumvented

**3. Removal of Corporate Donation Caps**
- Earlier: 7.5% of net profit over 3 years capped for corporate donations
- Electoral Bonds: Unlimited corporate contributions enabled
- Shell company creation incentivized for money laundering
- Unprofitable companies channeled undisclosed funds

**4. Right to Information & Informed Vote Violation**
- Citizens' fundamental right to know political party funding sources eroded
- "Informed vote" corollary of voting right compromised
- Asymmetrical advantage to ruling party (better positioned to misuse government machinery)
- Policy-making vulnerable to quid pro quo with donors

#### Arguments FOR Electoral Bonds (Government Defense)[410]
- Addressed "black money" in politics through KYC (Know-Your-Customer) checks
- Anonymous donations protecting donor privacy
- Modernizing political funding mechanism
- Court found these defenses inadequate; did not meet proportionality test

#### Current Status (2024-2025)
- **SBI Ordered**: To publish all Electoral Bond transaction data since April 12, 2019
- **Transparency Data Released**: Revealed ₹2,500+ crore in bonds; significant ruling party advantage
- **New Campaign Finance**: Reverting to pre-2017 system (transparent donations with caps)
- **Ongoing Impact**: Political party debt servicing concerns; fundraising mechanisms shifting

#### Previous Associations
- **Political Funding History**: Cash donations dominant pre-2017; transparency lacking
- **Corporate Lobbying**: Quid pro quo accusations in policy-making precedent
- **Transparency Advocates**: Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) spearheaded legal challenge

#### PESTEL Analysis

**Political**
- Fairness principle: Removal restores level playing field for electoral competition
- Transparency imperative: Citizens' right to know funding sources; democratic accountability
- Ruling party disadvantage: Post-removal, BJP must compete with visible funding disadvantage
- Opposition narrative: "Transparency victory" strengthening democratic credentials
- Judicial intervention: Supreme Court's unprecedented action setting institutional precedent

**Economic**
- Corporate influence reduction: Unlimited corporate donations now capped
- Campaign costs: Political spending still high but traceable; donor pressure likely decreasing
- Small donor incentives: Potentially attracting grassroots fundraising
- Shell company impact: Reduced corporate arbitrage opportunities; tax compliance improving

**Social**
- Democratic legitimacy: Election outcomes potentially more reflective of public opinion
- Voter trust: Restored confidence in electoral process fairness
- Minority representation: Level playing field potentially benefiting smaller parties
- Civil society: Enhanced role for transparency advocates; watchdog organizations strengthened

**Technological**
- Data analytics: Publishing of bond data enabling research on funding patterns
- Blockchain potential: Future schemes could use immutable ledgers for transparency
- Surveillance capacity: Government still holding transaction data; privacy vs. transparency tension

**Environmental**
- No direct environmental impact

**Legal**
- Constitutional jurisprudence: Supreme Court enforcing "basic structure" doctrine
- Precedent setting: First major instance of striking down Money Bill on substantive grounds
- Transparency law evolution: Right to Information (RTI) implications for funding disclosure
- Corporate accountability: Enhanced scrutiny of corporate political spending

#### Verdict: Fairness Restored
Electoral Bonds struck down on multiple constitutional grounds; restoration of transparency principles improving democratic fairness, though political funding opacity challenges persist through other mechanisms.
