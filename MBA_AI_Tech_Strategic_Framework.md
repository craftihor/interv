This political positioning differs sharply from EU's risk-centric approach, signaling government confidence in India's tech capability while raising safeguard questions.

**Key Political Decisions**:
- MeitY AI Governance Guidelines emphasize voluntary self-regulation and existing laws rather than creating enforceable obligations for high-risk AI uses in welfare, policing, digital infrastructure
- Digital Personal Data Protection Rules 2025 (November 13, 2025) operationalize DPDP Act 2023, creating mandatory compliance regime for organizations handling personal data
- Digital Competition Bill 2024 targets Big Tech monopolies, proposing ex-ante regulation similar to EU's DMA
- 2025 IT Rules Amendment mandates labeling of AI-generated content, requiring 10% of visual display area devoted to disclaimers

**Political Trade-offs**: Government balances growth enablement (light-touch regulation) against consumer protection (stricter compliance). Political signals suggest government prioritizes innovation speed; however, social media regulation amendments indicate response to domestic concerns about deepfakes, misinformation.

**Strategic Implication**: Political economy suggests India positioning itself as middle ground between EU's regulatory strictness and US's permissiveness—"innovation-friendly yet accountable."
